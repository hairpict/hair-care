<p>Those of you with curly hair may prefer more layering than those with straight hair no matter what you determined for the previous factors. Im learning so much through this website but one thing I dont understand about curly hair yet is how to cut itare layers a good thing or a bad thing. If your hair is superfine but you have a ton of hair you may want to ask your hairstylist to do a subtle undercut in the back so it doesnt appear too bulky and unflattering behind your head. Theyre a great idea if youre looking to develop some shape or get some volume into those curls of yours. This technique breaks up the layering so the hair doesnt have any strong or hard lines in it.
