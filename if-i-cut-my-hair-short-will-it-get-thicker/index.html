<p>Not everyone looks good with a short hair so what you decide has to be perfect for you. Another thing that you can do to make your hair look thicker and healthier is to have it cut in layers by a hair stylist. The short hair craze is back again and you are thinking of following the trend. You cant change the number of hair follicles you have no matter how often you rip hair out of them. Cutting hair short will make it look thicker and more voluminous because hairs are naturally thicker closer to the scalp.
