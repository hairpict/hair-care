<p>Coloring your hair gives your face a makeover and makes you look like a different person. Use quality hair conditioner and leave-on products to keep the layered hair down. The technique used depends on exactly how you want the finished cut to look but for the most choppy effect you want to perform what is known as point cutting where once the base haircut is completed you go back over the head and hold the hair in segments straight out from the scalp and cut inward from the ends of the hair at an angle to create notches in the hair. Layers can be added to either the entire hair style or to certain select portions. Smooth the pomade through 1-inch-sections of hair from just above. Pin On Hair Goals.</p>
