<p>Regardless if you cut it or not your hair will grow a quarter of an inch a month on average. If you want to grow you hair long you should only cut your hair when you start having damaged ends. When you trim or cut your hair you only reduce the length of the tips. Someone who has an eccentric haircut or hairstyle is more likely to have a vibrant eccentric or be out there personality-wise. You may grow out your hair and find out that you dont really like the way you look with long hair. Pin On My Hair Cut For April.</p>
