<p>Taking the dreams that made me up. And reach towards a love ever after. Lyrics for Beauty in Tragedy by August Burns Red. There is beauty in tragedy The heart wont stop beating For the end is a new beginning Where sorrow pulls the skyline of reality And restarts a love ever after As we grasp beyond defeat So keep us breathing a little longer For just one moment we couldnt offer This night is falling on my hearts shame These feelings bring tears to my eyes. Because of the events in my past I have become stronger and I can counsel others who deal with tragedy. Excerpt From Don T Lean On Me By The Amity Affliction C 2014 The Amity Affliction Amity Band Quotes.</p>
