<p>I dont know who needs to hear this but saying oppa in every other sentence isnt cute or endearing its just weird. There are plenty of differences between the Korean working world and the American one. The main word for how to say clothes in Korean is 옷 ot. In other words they can wear any clothes they want anytime they like it. However if you want to emphasize the fact you are speaking of clothes as multiple you may add the particle 들 deul after 옷 ot creating the word 옷들 otdeul. Pin On Clothes Fashion.</p>
