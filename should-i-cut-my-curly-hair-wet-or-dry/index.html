My personal preference on shaping curls is based on the curl pattern. Of course a well-versed haircutter will know how to avoid this undesirable result and be able to utilize wet cutting to its full potential. Pin On Hair Style.</p>

<p>I need a haircut. On the other hand if you have coarse textured hair thats on the curly end of the spectrum ask your stylist to give you a dry haircut. Alternatively if you want to cut it in layers when you cut it wet you can get it to be symmetrical. It bobs up as it dries when its curly and curls dry at different lengths. With a dry cut your barberhairstylist can pay extra attention to the patterns of your curls and be able to cut in a way that enhances them.

<p>Cutting curly hair when its wet is unpredictable and risky but it doesnt damage the hair in any way. With a dry cut your barberhairstylist can pay extra attention to the patterns of your curls and be able to cut in a way that enhances them. Only those pieces that need reshaping are cut. Curly hair is drastically shorter when dry than when wet. Cutting while wet allows the hair to stretch and bend which can distort the shape in the finished style.
