<p>Pinning it behind your ears gathers the thinner spots together giving the illusion of thicker hair. Remove the thinning shears and run a comb through the section. If you want to adjust any hair use the scissors to cut the individual lock. Many times when layering fine hair we tend to thin out the ends. I wanted to thin out the bottom layer first so that if I messed up while I was still getting the hang of it it wouldnt be that obvious. Pin On Hairstyles.</p>

<p>In case your hair is very thick you may need to trim through the braid couple of times more than one area. Now section by section trim the top of the hair until they exactly of the same length. Take a small section of hair about 12 inch thick hold the end of your hair out and starting about 34. Comb out sections of the hair and trim the ends holding the scissors angled vertically away from the head to create the layers. The key with even layering on thicker hair is elevation.
