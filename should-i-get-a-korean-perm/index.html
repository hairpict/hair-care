<p>Its no secret that girls with thin hair often do it in order to make hair bigger but keep in mind that perms actually work better on thick hair not thin. As Asian hair is super difficult to style perms allow it to maintain texture and to stay put. Hey guys Ive lurked on this sub Reddit for a while and decided to start posting cuz I would love some advice on this I have the stereotypical Asian hair stiff straight resistant to styling and it grows forward so slicking back into an undercut my favorite hairstyle is tough. I have thick Asian-Hawaiian hair and lots of it. That depends on many things so take some time to read this before you decide whether you should get a perm or change your hair in another way thats more suitable for you.
