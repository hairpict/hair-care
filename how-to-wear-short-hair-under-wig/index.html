<p>Even if you dont its still better to comb your hair back so that the combs or Velcro straps attach nicely to your hair. First off youre going to start by brushing your hair back. You do however need to make the two small flat pin curls on the top of your head see photo below. The hand-tied delicate finish allows you to part your hair in whatever place suits you best and the superfine front section provides the all-important undetectable hairlineA lace front wig is also great for ladies suffering from complete hair loss as many of our range are. What I personally do it pin-curl the shit out of it hair spraying all around my hairline and pulling a nylon tube style wig cap up my neck and over my face this gathers all those little strands and helps keep them in place.

Neatly brush your hair so that it doesnt get tangled under the wig cap if you want to wear one. This is currently how I tie my hair up to wear wigs. Pull all of your hair to the back in a low tight bun and secure it at the base of your head with pins. Pin Su Wigs Weaves And Frontals.</p>
