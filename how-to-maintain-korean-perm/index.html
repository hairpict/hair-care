<p>Heres a list of 10 KL salons for Korean perms that can give your hair fuss-free waves. In this video I will share my experiences about perming hair in Korea how to take care of perm hair. Your hair should be strong enough to withstand all the tugging chemicals and hair products or tools that a hairdresser will use during the perming process. The down perm prevents your hair from staying down even after getting your hair wet or washing it. But unlike the former the Korean wave perm features more defined curls and volume for a sophisticated appearance. Pin On Wedding.</p>
