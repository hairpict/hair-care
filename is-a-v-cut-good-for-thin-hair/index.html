<p>A long textured cut. A bob haircut is a fairly decent and relatively low-maintenance solution for fine hair. Typically the tresses in the front are shorter while the back layers are longer. It is a great haircut and needs minimum maintenance. With a bob or lob thats longer in the front youre building up or stacking the weight in one place which makes your hair look fuller.
