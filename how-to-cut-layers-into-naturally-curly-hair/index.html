<p>This technique helps to avoid the dreaded hair-triangle that can easily happen when curly hair is cut straight and blunt. You can grow your hair into long waist length curls without the traingle effect if you have thin hair. The CC1 Technique also called the Curl Cutting Technique was only created in 2019 and therefore is a relatively new cutting technique. This will ensure that the entire hair has the same length. I do cut my hair myself and it worked great for me I dont have a Deva salon less then a days drives away. Pin On Body Beautiful.</p>
