<p>You fell in love when I was only ten. When I am older than these small god damned hills And theres no reason for my mind to be still Oh how Ill feel like a beautiful child Such a beautiful child again When I have finally found my room filled with toys Be banging on my crib excited by noise Oh how Ill feel like a beautiful child Such a beautiful child again And when theres nothing to gain Or bring me pain or pin the blame On you or myself And when they finally fall These wailing walls and burdened crosses Gods twilights. Hold you again I fell into love You learnt how to fight Well I wish that you were mine Something that I said Made you wear a frown The way you hang your head Has made the tears come down But dont you wear a sigh My beautiful child You know it doesnt burn When you touch the sun So dont be concerned My golden one Youre gonna reach the sky. Who am I this time wheres my name. You are a beautiful childand I am a fool once more I bite my lipcan you send me away You touch I have no choice I have to stay You say it will be harder in the morning I wait for you to said Just go Im old enough to love you from afar Too trusting yes but then women usually are And the way she ended it during the SYW tour was wonderful. Nazim Hikmet Most Beautiful Words Beautiful Words The Best Is Yet To Come.</p>
