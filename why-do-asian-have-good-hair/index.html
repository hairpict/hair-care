<p>In Asia its mostly warm and sunny so they adapted to it by having more melatonin in their hair which absorbs harmful UV rays. The big question I wanted to find out was why do so many Asians have a bowl haircut. Asian hair has higher porosity levels meaning it absorbs and retains moisture better.</p>
<h3 id="that-is-the-good-news">That is the good news.</h3><p>The hormone plays a role in converting testosterone into an androgenic form. The amino acids in the fermented rice water help strengthen the hairs roots. It grows perpendicularly to the scalp. This in turn stimulates DHT which promotes hair growth. Asians have less body hair because of their lower androgenic levels stronger tolerance towards testosterone their unique EDAR gene mutation their variant Y-Chromosomes and their quick adaptation to cold climate and warm environments clothing during ancient times. That is the good news.</p>
