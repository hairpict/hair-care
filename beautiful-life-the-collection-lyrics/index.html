<p><strong>Beautiful Life The Collection Lyrics</strong>, Beautiful Life by The Collection released 30 March 2018 You do not have to be good even the best of us have been misunderstood so get up on to your feet the sun is shining repentance through the leaves its rays will wash you clean Im walking slowly Im taking my time All our lack of talking is starting to rhyme Im letting go of lonely letting go of strife I just cant get enough of this beautiful life I just cant get enough of this beautiful life. I just cant get enough of this beautiful life I just cant get enough of this beautiful life Oh you look so amazing Your hair it drives me crazy Dreaming of god on a sandy shore Saved by amazing grace Or maybe my lack of faith The seasons change but they come back the same Theyll wash you clean with their rays Im walking slowly Im taking my time. Its a beautiful life oh oh oh oh.</p>

I just cant get enough of this beautiful life I just cant get enough of this beautiful life Oh you look so amazing Your hair it drives me crazy Dreaming of god on a sandy shore Saved by amazing grace Or maybe my lack of faith The seasons change but they come back the same Theyll wash you clean with their rays Im walking slowly Im taking my time. Its a living every moment Like it could be our last For our hearts are restless til they rest in loves caress In the moments we remember They interweave our hearts. Painter of skies maker of stars Holder of seas and all our hearts Artist of life Father of lights When Im with You my soul ignites You see my sin but love me.
