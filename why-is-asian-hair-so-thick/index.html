<p>The only way to change your hair is to use a flat iron or go for a perm. I have thick asian hair that becomes poofy after showers. Stop shampooing everyday youre killing your hair. And while youre admiring the silky hair of the east asian girls you should know one fact. Ill drop a picture of my hair on a normal day no gel no nothing. 3 236 Likes 44 Comments Sal Salcedo Salsalhair On Instagram Transformation Salsalhair Beforeandafter Makeover Hair Styles Hair Short Hair Styles.</p>
