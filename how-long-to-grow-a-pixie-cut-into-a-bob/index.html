<p>When growing it out it took six months of hideousness - then they chopped it into a graduated bob short. Ive had a pixie of some sort for about two years now. At this point it was long enough to get wavy but still a bit too short to be able to do anything with it. Im currently on step 3 with a longer pixie. From Bob to Pixie. Pin On Hair.</p>
