<p>Masuzi July 25 2021UncategorizedLeave a comment3 Views. If your hair is wavy or curly adding layers to the hair will allow the shorter layers to curl more and will let you style the hair to add volume and give the appearance of more hair. Always always always load up some inspo photos on your cell. If your hair is naturally straight as a board a layered haircut is a universally flattering style that adds both depth and movement. And dont let your hairdresser talk you into a cut that requires tons of productstyling tools to look halfway decent.
