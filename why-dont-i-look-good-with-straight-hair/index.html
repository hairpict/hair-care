<p><strong>Why Dont I Look Good With Straight Hair</strong>, Notice how anyone with curly hair when not straightened looks shorter than when it is straight.

<p>People with naturally straight hair can skimp on the extra shine serum because the straight surface of the hair reflects more light can be smoother and thus shinier. As someone with curly hair who always straightens it I think it gets labelled good hair because straight hair is usually silky and smooth it also looks longer as curly hair is frizzy tangles easy and looks shorter because of gravity. People with naturally straight hair can skimp on the extra shine serum because the straight surface of the hair reflects more light can be smoother and thus shinier. Because my natural straight hair doesnt give that shine also they arent smoother as compared to making it more straighter with hair iron temporary or with chemicals permanent aka rebounding smoothening etc. Its easy to grow out.
