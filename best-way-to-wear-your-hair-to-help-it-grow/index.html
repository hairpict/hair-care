<h3 id="found-in-fruits-vegetables-and-nuts-this-vitamin-helps-keep-hair-thick-and-strong">Found in fruits vegetables and nuts this vitamin helps keep hair thick and strong.</h3><p>1 A simple way to stimulate hair growth at home is to give yourself a scalp massage. After you finish washing your hair its best to let it dry naturally or use a hairdryer on the lowest possible setting. I just want to suggest that you be sure that the style is done correctly and in a manner that is not harmful to your hair. Try to avoid drying your hair roughly with a towel which can both mess it up and irritate your scalp. Eating a healthy diet and staying hydrated can help your hair grow in thicker and glossier which is a plus when youre trying to grow it out. Finally if youre going to tie your hair back use a proper hair tie.</p>
