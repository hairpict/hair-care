<p>If you have wavy fine hair that is sparse under average amount of hair per square inch or square centimeter cutting your hair into. For those with naturally thin and straight hair adding layers to your hair will help add volume and create more. Layers are a great for thin hair if done properly. Truly thin hair can look even thinner with layers. When I have a client with thin hair I would normally suggest a blunt cut with layers.
