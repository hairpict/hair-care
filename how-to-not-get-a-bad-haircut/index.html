<p>Slicking your hair back with gel into a sleek ponytail will also keep the hair out of your faceand off of your mind. Use a tiny bit of jojoba or coconut or olive or almost oil on your fingertips and work from the front of your hairline to the back in slow circular movements. During that time Josh suggests deep conditioners will help provide the conditioning that dry hair needs. Dont be curtailed by your barbers lack of skill. Yeah just tough it out.
