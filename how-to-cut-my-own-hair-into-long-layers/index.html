There is a long circle cut in which the hair is cut to uniform lengths so that if all the hairs were to stand straight out from the head it would form a circular halo of hair. 180 is an extreme angle for a long shape and can cause the shorter layers to push into the length and lay very flat. Start with dry hair and use a paddle brush to work through any knots. Pin On Hair.</p>

<p>Here are some of the basic hair cutting materials you will need and the two ways of layering hair. 180 is an extreme angle for a long shape and can cause the shorter layers to push into the length and lay very flat. Keep checking with the hand mirror as you go. Slide your fingers toward the tips of your hair until they are level with the place where you want your shortest layers to start. To do that clip the top two-thirds of your hair up and out of the way. Pin On Make Up.</p>
