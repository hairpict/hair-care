<p>A split end may occur whenever your hair is dry or gets damaged through friction. When you cut your hair you cut off the part that is damaged and depending on how much you cut off you can remove all of the split and damaged ends and therefore the hair is healthier and will tangle less. When the scalp is free from oils dirt and sebum hair will grow more healthily. This cant always be achieved you may not want to cut off that much all at once if you hair is very damaged but one big. But theres a reason experts suggest trimming your hair every six to eight weeks. Pin On Hairstyles.</p>
