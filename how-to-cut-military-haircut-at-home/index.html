Most military guys prefer the fade haircut since it is very easy to maintain. To style the military regulation haircut use a medium to high shine pomade like the Regal Gentleman Vintage Pomade coming soon to give you the more slicked look. Pin On Guy Hair.</p>

<p>We are bringing together the experienced and professionally trained hairstylists that are a part of or who serve our military community and giving them a platform to share their knowledge with those who are having to learn how to cut their own hair at home during this pandemic lockdown. This haircut requires a great deal of crew cut fading which is difficult but not impossible to do at home by yourself. With a Fade haircut the length of the hair on top can vary but for army personnel the hair on top should not be longer than two inches. Brush cut wont give you a flat top when lifted up. So sides and back do not require any fading nor styling. Pin On Gents Hairstyles.</p>
