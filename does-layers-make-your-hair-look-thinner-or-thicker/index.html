<p>1 Dont fall into the mullet trap. To put in layers the hairdresser will play with different lengths of strands. Mullets are friends to no one. Adding color to your roots typically a slightly darker color helps add depth to the look of your hair also. Whether you get highlights or lowlights try to stay away from one wash of color.

<p>Youre not getting a layered haircut. My hair is fine in texture and I would say medium density but depending on the weather and styling it can look super thin or fuller. Whether you get highlights or lowlights try to stay away from one wash of color. For those dealing with flat strands styling can seem like a waste of effort when you know itll just deflate by noon. Does layers make hair look thicker or thinner. Pin On V Cut Haircuts.</p>
